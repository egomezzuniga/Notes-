# Notes-
Allowing the watch to write quick notes on the screen for later use. Such as Numbers and small notes to remember in the future. For example the parking stall Number to remember where you parked.
Trying to create an appliction of the Tic watch where you can write a smiple note. 
So that when you need to refer back to it its just saved on the application of the tic watch.
